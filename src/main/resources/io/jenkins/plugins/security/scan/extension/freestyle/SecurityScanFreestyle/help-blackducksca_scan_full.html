    Specify the scan mode to use. Recommended <code>Auto</code> mode uses <code>Rapid</code> scan for PR scans and <code>Intelligent</code> scans for non-PR scans. All post scan features such as PR comments are only supported in this mode. Use <code>Intelligent</code> or <code>Rapid</code> scan modes only if you want to set the scan type for both PR and non-PR contexts but note that post scan features such as PR comments are not supported.
